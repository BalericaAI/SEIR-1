SEIR → SEIR-I Pathway

A Multi-Year Applied Arc in Infrastructure, Identity, and Trust
Overview
SEIR teaches how systems are built.
SEIR-I teaches how systems decide who is trusted.
Together, they form a complete engineering foundation.


The SEIR → SEIR-I pathway is a four-year applied engineering track designed to develop professionals who can be trusted with systems, access, and responsibility.

This pathway is not built around trends or certifications alone. It is built around judgment, evidence, and operational maturity—the qualities required to operate real systems in production environments.

Students typically complete SEIR (Years 1–2) followed by SEIR-I (Years 3–4). Some students overlap the programs depending on workload and experience.


Beginning: SEIR — Systems Engineering & Infrastructure Responsibility
Focus: How systems are built, automated, and operated.

Students learn how modern infrastructure works at a fundamental level using public cloud platforms, automation, and CI/CD pipelines. Emphasis is placed on reading plans, controlling blast radius, debugging failures, and remaining calm when systems do not behave as expected.

Key outcomes:
    Infrastructure-as-code with Terraform
    Cloud networking, compute, and scaling
    CI/CD pipelines with gates and evidence
    Operational debugging and failure analysis
    Structured use of AI as a bounded assistant (e.g., OpenAI) & Vertex

By the end of SEIR, students understand how systems exist and how to take responsibility for them.

Middle: SEIR-I — Systems Engineering & Identity Responsibility
Focus: Who is trusted to access systems, and why.

SEIR-I builds on SEIR by introducing identity as the control plane of modern environments. Students learn how identity is designed, extended, and defended across cloud platforms using Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Entra ID (Azure Active Directory) (Microsoft Entra ID, Google Cloud Platform).

Key outcomes:
    Identity lifecycle and access control
    Federation, SAML, SSO, and trust boundaries
    Extending Microsoft identity into GCP
    PowerShell automation for identity systems
    Auditability, logging, and recovery
    AI-assisted analysis with strict human control

By the end of SEIR-I, students understand how trust is established and preserved.

Why This Pathway Matters
In real organizations:
    Infrastructure determines what can run
    Identity determines who is trusted
    Failures in either can cause severe damage

Completing both programs prepares students for roles where they are expected to:
    design systems responsibly
    control access deliberately
    explain risk clearly
    operate under audit and pressure

Roles This Pathway Prepares Students For
    Platform Engineer
    Cloud / Infrastructure Engineer
    Identity & Access Management (IAM) Engineer
    Security Engineer (Identity-focused)
    Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)
    Enterprise Systems Engineer

This pathway is designed for long-term career durability, not short-term credential stacking.
